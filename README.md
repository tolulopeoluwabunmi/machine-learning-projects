# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

A collection of supervised machine learning projects developed using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.  
Each project explores a real-world dataset, applies data preprocessing, builds classification models,  
and evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices.
